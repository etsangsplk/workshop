## Blockchain workshop April 2018
Welcome to the Blockchain developers course.

### Installation
During the first half of the course we'll work mostly with Python 3.6.
We'll need to add the package `ecdsa` to our environemnt.

This repository cointains a Pipefile with `python 3.6`, `ecdsa`,  `base58` and `jupyer`.

For newcommers it's recommended to install it with `pipenv`

```
# Download and install pipenv
pip install pipenv

# Get the repository
clone the repository and cd into it

# Install dependencies 
pipenv install

# Run virtual environemnt
pipenv shell

# Run jupyer
pipenv jupyter notebook
```
